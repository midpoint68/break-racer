Break Racer

Break Racer is a game where the user controls a 'racecar' made of weighted pixels.
These weighted pixels are squares with assigned weight or 'integrity' to them that
influences the force they apply when colliding with other pixels. Additionaly, there is a
Connective Force that keeps pixels together.

    -If a pixel has a high connective force, it will take more force to break it from its neighbor.
    -This breaking process is checked regularly only when the pixel is being moved. if the
      pixel collides with another pixel, a force will be calculated and applied to both pixels
      which will transfer onto all connected pixels with an energy loss across each transfer.
        -Force = Integrity*Acceleration
        -Acceleration = Velocity/Time

    -Pixels will also have a Friction value that determines how much Force is applied when two
      pixels have a parallel interaction.
        -0000 [0 : empty]
        -0+00 [+ : pixel]
        -0+<0 [</> : direction of pixel movement]
        -0000
        -The bottom pixel is 'touching' the top pixel, but only has movement to the left.
          Therefore it will only apply a force on the upper pixel multiplied by both of their
          friction values combined.

When does a pixel break?

    -A pixel breaks when the applied force on it is greater than the connective force that exists
      between it and its neighbors, regardless of direction. This is for simplicity of calculation.
      Therefore, even if the force is in the same direction as the connective force between its
      neighbor, it will still break if the force is too great.

What happens when a pixel breaks?
    
    -When a pixel breaks, its connective force is subtracted from the applied force on it and the
      pixel has the new force applied to it. This allows for some unique situations to occur.
          -Consider this: A single pixel on the edge of a car is hit with a large applied force
            which exceeds that of its FIRST checked connective force (should be random or
            directional checks). It's first connective force will break, and then its new applied
            force is calculated, but is not enough to break the next connective force. Therefore,
            it is left with its remaining connections. This allows the pixel to be 'hanging by a
            thread.'

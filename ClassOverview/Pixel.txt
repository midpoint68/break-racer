Pixel:

  *Color        color         get/set
  *Structure    structure     get/set
  *var          integrity     get
  *var          friction      get
  -var          appliedForce  get/set
  -Connection{} connection    get/set   //dictionary with up, down, left, right
  
  applyForce(var forceMagnitude):
    - sets appliedForce to forceMagnitude plus appliedForce
    - checks to see if the applied force on the pixel will break its connections
    - this does NOT influence the parent structure's velocity, and is purely for calculating
      breaking force.
    - this is called by structure.applyForce()
    
  breakConnection(var direction):
    - called by applyForce when it needs to break a connection between this and another pixel
    - calls applyForce with the new depricatedForce
    - If no breaks, sets appliedForce to zero

  depricatedForce(var forceMagnitude, integrity, brokenIntegrity):
    - calculates the new appliedForce based off of the previous forceMagnitude, the given Integrity, and the broken Integrity
    - returns the new appliedForce

  Connection:
    
    *var    connectForce  get/set
    *Pixel  neighbor      get
    
    break():
      - breaks the connection to the other Pixel
      - passes the connective force/2 to the neighbor.
